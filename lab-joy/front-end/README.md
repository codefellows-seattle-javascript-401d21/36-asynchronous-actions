# Lab 36 - Aysnchronous Actions
Joy Hou, Mar 5, 2018

## Description
In this lab, we created a front end with React and Redux for the back-end that we created in Lab 14. The front end allows the user create authors and notes associated with each author.

Components: dashboard, author-form, author-item, note-form, note-item
Actions: author-actions, note-actions
Reducers: index, author, note
Lib: store, utils, redux-reporter, redux-thunk

## .env
NODE_ENV=dev

## How To Use
* Follow the instructions in the back-end README to start up the back end
* From the front-end directory in your terminal, use "npm run watch"
* You can now access the website from your browser via the URL "http://localhost:8080"
* To run tests, from the front-end directory of your terminal, use "npm run test"
